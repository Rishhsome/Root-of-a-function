# Root-of-a-function
The algorithm of the program uses 'Binary Search' to find the root of any given function within a given interval.
The basic idea of the algorithm comes from the concept of 'Intermediate Value Theorem' in Mathematics.
We have to input the function into the program before running and then after executing, provide the values of 'a' & 'b' (closed interval).
The program will fetch you the value of the root of the function, correct up to 4 decimal places (if it exits between the given interval).
If the root doesn't exist between the given interval, it will tell you to input correct values of 'a' & 'b'.
